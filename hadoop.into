This is the collection of my hadoop notes 

#Once it has been archived on storage devices such as tapes, it can only be used in case of emergency to retrieve important data. However, processing or analyzing this data to get insight efficiently is very difficult. This is changing. Organizations want to now use this data to get insight to help understand existing problems, seize new opportunities, and be more profitable. The study and analysis of these vast volumes of data has given birth to a term called big data

#With the data growing at such a rapid rate, traditional tools for storage and analysis fall short. Though these days the cost per byte has reduced considerably and the ability to store more data has increased, the disk transfer rate has remained the same. This has been a bottleneck for processing large volumes of data.
